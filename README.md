### **What's Inside**

Every file in this repository represents a LeetCode problem I have solved. My solutions are primarily in **C++** and **Python**, with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

Each solution includes:
* A clear implementation of the algorithm.
* In-line comments explaining the logic and thought process.
* Analysis of **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** to demonstrate an understanding of performance optimization.

### **My Approach**

I believe that the best solutions are not just correct but also elegant and scalable. My process involves:
1.  **Understanding the problem**: Deconstructing the prompt to identify constraints and core requirements.
2.  **Developing a strategy**: Exploring multiple approaches (e.g., brute force, greedy, dynamic programming) before selecting the most optimal one.
3.  **Writing clean code**: Ensuring the solution is readable and maintainable.
4.  **Analyzing performance**: Evaluating the solution's efficiency and identifying areas for improvement.

### **Skills Highlighted**

This repository is a testament to my proficiency in a wide range of topics, including:
* **Fundamental Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Heaps, and Graphs.
* **Core Algorithms**: Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithms.
* **Language Proficiency**: Expertise in writing robust and efficient code in C++ and Python.

This project demonstrates my ability to learn independently, apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, and maintain a disciplined and organized workflowâ€”all essential skills for a software development role.
